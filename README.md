*Introduction*
In this project, we have performed in-depth analysis on weather data collected from various regions in India. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the climate patterns, temperature variations, rainfall trends, and other weather-related phenomena in different parts of the country.

*Data*
*Data Sources*
The weather data used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. It includes historical records of temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant weather parameters for multiple regions in India.

*Data Preprocessing*
Before analysis, we conducted data preprocessing tasks, including:

Data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
Data transformation to ensure consistency and compatibility.
Feature engineering to extract relevant information.
The cleaned and processed dataset is available in the data directory.

**Analysis**
Our data analysis consists of several key components:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We performed EDA to understand the distribution of weather variables, identify patterns, and visualize trends in the data.

Statistical Analysis: We conducted statistical tests to investigate relationships between different weather variables and regions. This helps uncover significant insights.
